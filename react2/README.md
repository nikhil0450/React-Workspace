# Getting Started with Create React App

### In this repository folder, I have work on mainly both `Function Based Components` & `Class Based Components`

### We learnt what is `props` in detail with 

### Class - constructor, methods, state, props, 'this' keyword

### Conditional Rendering, `ternary operator`, `Logical Rendering`

### React with and without using `JSX` 

### Changing the text using `useState` in `MessageClass.js` & `MessageFunc.js`

### Event Handling & Event Binding 

### Click event handle in FBC & CBC

### Counter made in class component using state

### Parent & Child component passing values & event handling using props

### Rendering Array, Object or JSON data using `map` function e.g. `ProductList.js`
Parent - `NameList.js` 

Child - `Person.js`
